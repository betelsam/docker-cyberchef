# docker-cyberchef

Quickly spin up a **local instance** of the awesome **CyberChef** tool using this tiny docker image. Use this when baking around in shady places where it is not possible to load the official live instance from https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/.

See https://hub.docker.com/r/betelsam/cyberchef/ for details.
